## Instructions

- Fill the cells.
- **Bold** irregularly-shaped boxes represent blocks.
- Number and operation on a block's top-left corner represents the entire block.
- 4 operations for blocks: ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗
	- ➕ : Numbers of the block should add up to the representative number.
	- ➖ : Absolute difference of two numbers in the block should equal the *representative*.
	- ✖️ : Multiplying the numbers should equal the *representative*.
	- ➗ : Dividing the larger number by the smaller number should equal the *representative*.
- No number repeated in a row or column.
- Use the *representative* if there's no operation.
