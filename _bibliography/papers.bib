  abstract    = {The value of quality treebanks is steadily increasing due to the crucial role they play in the development of natural language processing tools. The creation of such treebanks is enormously labor-intensive and time-consuming. Especially when the size of treebanks is considered, tools that support the annotation process are essential. Various annotation tools have been proposed, however, they are often not suitable for agglutinative languages such as Turkish. BOAT-v1 was developed for annotating dependency relations and was subsequently used to create the manually annotated BOUN Treebank (UD_Turkish-BOUN). In this work, we report on the design and implementation of a dependency annotation tool (BOAT-v2) based on the experiences gained from the use of BOAT-v1, which revealed several opportunities for improvement. BOAT-v2 is a multi-user and web-based dependency annotation tool that is designed with a focus on the annotator user experience to yield valid annotations. The main obiectives of the tool are to: (1) support creating valid and consistent annotations with increased speed, (2) significantly improve the user experience of the annotator, (3) support collaboration among annotators, and (4) provide an open-source and easily deployable web-based annotation tool with a flexible application programming interface (API) to benefit the scientific community. This paper discusses the requirements elicitation, design, and implementation of BOAT-v2 along with examples.},

  abstract    = {In this study, we aim to offer linguistically motivated solutions to resolve the issues of the lack of representation of null morphemes, highly productive derivational processes, and syncretic morphemes of Turkish in the BOUN Treebank without diverging from the Universal Dependencies framework. In order to tackle these issues, new annotation conventions were introduced by splitting certain lemmas and employing the MISC (miscellaneous) tab in the UD framework to denote derivation. Representational capabilities of the re-annotated treebank were tested on a LSTM-based dependency parser and an updated version of the BoAT Tool is introduced.},

  abstract    = {Access to natural language processing resources is essential for their continuous improvement. This can be especially challenging in educational institutions where the software development effort required to package and release research outcomes may be overwhelming and under-recognized. Access towell-prepared and reliable research outcomes is important both for their developers as well as the greater research community. This paper presents an approach to address this concern with two main goals: (1) to create an open-source easily deployable platform where resources can be easily shared and explored, and (2) to use this platform to publish open-source Turkish NLP resources (datasets and tools) created by a research lab. The Turkish Natural Language Processing (TULAP) was designed and developed as an easy-to-use platform to share dataset and tool resources which supports interactive tool demos. Numerous open access Turkish NLP resources have been shared on TULAP. All tools are containerized to support portability for custom use. This paper describes the design, implementation, and deployment of TULAP with use cases (available at https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/). A short video demonstrating our system is available at https://figshare.com/articles/media/TULAP{\_}Demo/22179047.},
