Boğaziçi University Annotation Tool (BoAT) is a _collaborative_ web tool for linguistic annotation. I have started working on it in Feb 2022 as part of [my BSc senior project](https://seniorprojects.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/semesters/2022-spring/a-collaborative-web-tool-for-linguistic-annotation), advised by [Susan Uskudarli](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/people/suzan.uskudarli). The project is still continuing. It can be found on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/furkanakkurt1335/boat). I had made a reference video for the project as part of the course CMPE492, [here](https://youtu.be/5OD3j2mlMzc).

I have presented [a paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3315/paper01.pdf) on BoAT at [ALTNLP 2022](https://www.altnlp.org) in Jun 2022. After more evaluations of the tool, I have presented it again at [SCOL 2023](http://scol.boun.edu.tr/scol/23) in May 2023. The presentation video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BtRVqgtxK8c).
