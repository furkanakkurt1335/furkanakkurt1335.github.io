Turkish Language Processing Platform (TULAP) is a platform for aggregating Turkish NLP resources developed at Boğaziçi University. It's at the address [tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr](https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr).

It is an instance of the **r**esearch **o**utput **p**latform developed by [TABILab](https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr). The platform itself is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/BOUN-TABILab-TULAP/tabi-rop). It has two components. One is the repository, based on DSpace. The other is for the tool demos, based on a combination of 2 containers: [Node](https://nodejs.org) (front-end) and [Python](https://python.org) (API).

I have been part of the project since Feb 2022. I have presented [our demonstration paper](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-demo.25) on TULAP at EACL 2023, as a representative of TABILab. Our demonstration video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/iYUkV8mHeD4).
