Watching 'Wife of a Spy (2020)', film of the day on MUBI.

1h27m in, is there a twist coming right about now? 😶

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="/assets/video/hayhay.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
        <div class="caption">
            Do we say it like this in Turkey?
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Finished the film. So what really happened to the _spy_ though? And did he snitch on his wife, by _pointing to the ship_? Can Kurosawa-san answer these questions? 🤷‍♂️
