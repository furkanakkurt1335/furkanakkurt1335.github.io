## Instructions

- Fill the cells with numbers $$1$$ through $$N$$ in a grid of size $$N\times N$$.
- No number repeated in a row or column.
- **Bold** irregularly-shaped boxes represent blocks.
- Number and operation on a block's top-left corner *represents* the entire block.
- 4 operations
	- $$+$$ : Numbers of the block should add up to the representative number.
	- $$-$$ : Absolute difference of two numbers in the block should equal the *representative*.
	- $$\times$$ : Multiplying the numbers should equal the *representative*.
	- $$\div$$ : Dividing the larger number by the smaller number should equal the *representative*.
- Use the *representative* if there's no operation.
