We talked about what ontologists do last week in class.
I searched for some _Ontologist_ jobs.
I was pleased to see that the companies look for _linguists_ as well as other technical professions.

While at it, I saw one _ontologist_ argue<sup>[1](#references)</sup> that ontologists are language engineers: not in the sense of engineering or creating new languages ([_conlanging_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)), but standardizing the language used by a group of people working towards a goal.
I'm quoting, from his 2016 LinkedIn article:

> <span style="font-family: tahoma; font-style: normal">I would estimate that 50% of all code that has been written in the last twenty years [is for] translating between representations.</span>

Very sad. 😢

Ontology creation resembles object-oriented design.
As such, creating an ontology is also similar to creating a dictionary.
When we create a class in a program or an ontology, it's similar to creating a dictionary.
We _define_ what a class is by its variables (literal or object) and methods.

People are different; if we asked a few people to define an <span style="color: red">apple</span> by a class, we'd get an _exact_ few amount of different classes.
Ontologists create clear classes, distinguishing between entities and their properties.
Utilizing this experience, they establish standards that programmers use.
When an ontology is organized well, transferring work mentioned above becomes less of a burden and takes less time.
