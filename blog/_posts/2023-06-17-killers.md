There's a running sentiment in contemporary rap that I found and want to share. Somewhat philosophical.

J. Cole raps in [A Tale of 2 Citiez](https://genius.com/J-cole-a-tale-of-2-citiez-lyrics) (Dec 2014):

> Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits

Kendrick raps on [Worldwide Steppers](https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-worldwide-steppers-lyrics) (May 2022):

> I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch  
> We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch

> The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?  
> Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower

WESTSIDE BOOGIE raps in [KILLA MODE](https://genius.com/Westside-boogie-killa-mode-lyrics) (Jun 2022):

> Everybody killer, on my mama, everybody killer

Lyrics are taken from [Genius](https://genius.com).

What do they mean that *every*body is a killer? Just "push" them to the edge, or just leave them; either way, they're killers. Pushing someone to an extremely vulnerable position may be foreseen but a normal, holy no less, person is a killer *too*? Does he (K.Dot) mean that 'just being a cog in the wheel' makes you accountable as well?

Can't talk about Boogie's stance, he just makes a direct statement.
