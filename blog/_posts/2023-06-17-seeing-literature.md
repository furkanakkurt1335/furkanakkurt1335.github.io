Poetry is toiling over words to construct plot twists for the listener to enjoy. Some poets turn out to be full of themselves.

Al-Mutanabbi (المتنبّي) is an **in**credible poet from the 10th century. He wrote<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Mutanabbi)</sup>:

> | أنا الذي نظر الأعمى إلى أدبي | I am the one whose literature can be seen (even) by the blind |
> | و أسمعت كلماتي من به صمم | And whose words are heard (even) by the deaf. |

Rap is poetry over some beats. It tends to be filled with self-regard, to say the least.

J. Cole raps in his song 'January 28th' (Dec 2014) with a similar sentiment to his long gone predecessor<sup>[2](https://genius.com/J-cole-january-28th-lyrics)</sup>:

> Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness

I'm assuming such conceit has existed for as long as humankind.
