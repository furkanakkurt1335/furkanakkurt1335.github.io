I was reading [the blog](http://simia.net/wiki/Main_Page) of ["Denny" Vrandečić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Vrande%C4%8Di%C4%87) and came across [a post](http://simia.net/wiki/Semantic_Web_patent), titled "Semantic Web patent" and dated 29 December 2006. In the short post, he talks about his discovery of [the first patent for _Semantic Web_](https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/aii_fac_pub/226), which was filed by [Amit Sheth](http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/~amit) et al. in 30 October 2001.

In the post, he also mentions that Tim Berners-Lee spoke of [the need for _semantics_ in the Web](https://www.w3.org/Talks/WWW94Tim) in 1994 but he did not mention the term _semantic web_ specifically. Although the patent may have been filed by Amit Sheth et al., I found out that Sir Tim had written [a draft titled "Semantic Web Road map"](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html) in 1998. It seems that the term already existed but filing a patent for the creation of a semantic web was to be left to somebody else. There is also [a paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/895864), published before the patent, which has the term "Semantic Web" in its title. A little search also reveals that Sir Tim has some articles published on [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/35074206) and [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-semantic-web) before the patent but in 2001.

Denny’s blog post had initially propelled me to write a post similar to his regarding the term "Social Web" but maybe next week.
