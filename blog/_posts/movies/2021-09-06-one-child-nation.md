Started watching this documentary on Amazon Prime called "One Child Nation" (2019).

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <div class="caption">
            A rural villager lady talking about the policy back then, and smiling too.
        </div>
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/movies/villager-sterilization.png" title="villager-sterilization" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

I can't even post what the old village officer said he saw, in a following scene. "It was really fucked up."  
I don't know if I can continue this doc, 44 min in.  
Okay, just finished it. No words. I'll leave a picture here:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/movies/writing-wall.jpg" title="writing-wall" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

So much like _Animal Farm_'s barn writings on the wall, seems animals can write in real life too. (must be pigs)  

> "My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"  
> For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:  
> ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL  
> BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS

Side note: had watched Chess from Explained by Vox beforehand. I learned that the players' blood pressure can be as high as marathon runners. What?
