[The initial proposal for the web](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) seems like a technical document but it’s not designed for technicalities only, as its author, Tim Berners-Lee, says in his book [_Weaving the Web_](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html): "The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect — to help people work together — and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world."<sup>[1](#references)</sup> He uses the word _web_ to describe humanity’s existence in the world, probably a well-known metaphor by the time.

Today, the word _web_ is mostly associated with the Internet. It’s what comes to mind when somebody mentions the Web. _web_ being used to describe a set of relations between documents and machines is a metaphor, likening it to a web of people. On the other hand, describing a group of people as a web seems to start around the first quarter of the 20th century. This metaphor comes directly from the word’s physical meaning of "a network of fine threads".<sup>[2](#references)</sup>

As Sir Tim says, the Web has been intended to have a social effect, so it’s no wonder the phrase "social Web" came right after the initial Web came into fruition. In 1996, [Howard Rheingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Rheingold), an American critic, coins the term "social Web".<sup>[3](#references)</sup>

Now a big part of this _social Web_, social media sites begin after a popular diary community _Open Diary_ is founded on 1998. Blogging also starts around this time as "weblog" and the word _blog_ (which is what I’m doing right now) seems to be from a compound of two words _web_ and _log_.<sup>[4](#references)</sup> One year later, a blogger turns the compound in jest into a sentence of "we blog" and we’ve been using the word _blog_ ever since.<sup>[5](#references)</sup>
