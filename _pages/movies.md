### 9/8

Watching 'Wife of a Spy (2020)' [film of the day on MUBI], 15:42

Do we say it like this in Turkey? :

Finished the film. So what really happened to the _spy_ though? And did he snitch on his wife, by _pointing to the ship_? Can Kurosawa-san answer these questions? 🤷‍♂️

### 9/6

Just finished Chess from Explained by Vox. I learned that the players' blood pressure can be as high as marathon runners. What? 13:09

Just watching this documentary on Amazon Prime called "One Child Nation" (2019). A rural villager lady talking about the policy back then, and smiling too:

I can't even post what the old village officer said he saw, in a following scene. "It was really fucked up."  
I don't know if I can continue this doc, 44 min in.  
Okay, just finished it. No words. I'll leave a picture here:

![wall](images/writing, wall.jpg)

So much like _Animal Farm_'s barn writings on the wall, seems animals can write in real life too. (must be pigs)  

> "My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"  
For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:  
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL  
BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
