## 2021

### 9/9

Blood Brothers, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, Netflix Documentary (2021); What kind of language is that, _boy_?

### 9/8

Watching 'Wife of a Spy (2020)' [film of the day on MUBI], 15:42  
1h27m, is there a twist coming right about now üò∂, 18:21  
Do we say it like this in Turkey? :

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="/movies/videos/hayhay.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Finished the film. So what really happened to the _spy_ though? And did he snitch on his wife, by _pointing to the ship_? Can Kurosawa-san answer these questions? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 9/6

Just finished Chess from Explained by Vox. I learned that the players' blood pressure can be as high as marathon runners. What? 13:09

Just watching this documentary on Amazon Prime called "One Child Nation" (2019). A rural villager lady talking about the policy back then, and smiling too:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/movies/images/villager, sterilization.png" title="villager, sterilization" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I can't even post what the old village officer said he saw, in a following scene. "It was really fucked up."  
I don't know if I can continue this doc, 44 min in.  
Okay, just finished it. No words. I'll leave a picture here:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="/movies/images/writing, wall.jpg" title="writing, wall" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

So much like _Animal Farm_'s barn writings on the wall, seems animals can write in real life too. (must be pigs)  

> "My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"  
> For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a single Commandment. It ran:  
> ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL  
> BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
