I am an MSc student in Computer Engineering at [Boğaziçi University](https://boun.edu.tr) in Istanbul, Turkey, advised by [Susan Uskudarli](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~uskudarli). I am also a member of [TABILab](https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr). My research interests include computational linguistics, linguistic variation and phonology. I'm hoping to merge my interests in linguistics and computer science in my research.

I'm also currently helping with the system administration at [TETAM](https://tetam.boun.edu.tr).
