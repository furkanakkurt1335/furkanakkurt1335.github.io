No milk, No Petito. Gotta buy it after the market opens. 7:10  
Watched 'Your Skin' from Explained, Vox; the guy said he doesn't use soap other than for his hands, I mean I did that for years for my body as well, not hair though. 8:41  
Went and bought 2 cartons of milk ü•õ and drank[?] Petito, 9:38  
Just woke up, slept from 11a, a slight interruption at 12p, 14:27  
Watched Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (1936), 15:29  
Trying to move / transfer to GitHub Pages with Google Domains from Google Sites, 17:36  
Fiddling around to structure the web pages for a while now, 22:47  
Seen mu2q on Google Podcasts now as well, nice. Tried to make an RSS parser of sorts, 23:09  
Just listened to some Sami Yusuf with my little brother üßí, as it's our drifting-to-sleep ritual 23:51  
Let me include some 'Sari Gelin':

6a woke up. Have a final at 9:30. I'll eat some Petito now. 6:42  
Ate Petito, made tea out of a teabag, will drink it now. Should study now, right? 7:14  
I have heard it said what you should do is, 33m [Tim Vine](https://youtu.be/6HsZgmY48iU?t=1918) 7:18  
Should study _now_ 7:19  
Whew, that's over. Also, I just tried to pour tea on an upside down tea glass. It looked so normal.
12:05  
I just ate two pieces of la·∏•m  øajƒ´n (aka Turkish Pizza) and they were delicious but too spicy. 16:34
