Rap is competitive. There aren’t many rappers not competitive in their lyrics. I can’t think of *one* but I’m sure they exist. Rap comes in many subgenres but all aspire to be the greatest of the entire *game*. Who’s got it?

There is the idea that there are many goats. If you’re one of the goats, I’m sure you think you’re *the* <span style="color:gray">(/ˈðiː/)</span> goat. Symba articulates this in [GOAT](https://open.spotify.com/track/2hXfs7Y9jN0Vfh5YVJQtHn?si=4f826a0b918741e3) well.

The idea of *all time* is difficult as well. Some give way to nostalgia and won’t hear of the new rappers’ greatness, while others aren’t even aware of the old school (meaning only one generation older, since the concept *old* is recursive).

What’s the criteria? For me, it’s lyrics. My quite *"radical"* idea is that if a rap song is bad without the beat, it’s bad. I know too many listeners are involved with the beat business and would dislike a song if it had a bad beat. That’s why I think it’s somewhat radical. But the same listeners also love freestyling without a beat or with only a human-made one so it’s not clear cut.

Saying *lyrics* is not enough. All the songs have lyrics. Or saying word play. Playing with words have levels and layers. I guess the initial layers would be about the rhymes. How many syllables rhyming with what structure? The further layers would be meanings. How many entendres? Quadruple?

I have listened to quite a lot of rap. Too much in fact. But for me, *not* enough. My favorites changed over time but *favorite* does not equal 🐐. I have listened to American rap the most but also to Turkish rap in the past, and some UK, Italian, Korean, etc.

This is not an objective question from the start. *Your* goat should be the one you would choose to listen to the rest of your life without any other rapper. However, it’s also true that listening to many different people and styles is enjoyful. In fact, the competition comes out of multiplicity. Variation is the concept that gravitates me towards rap and any other lyrical form. I love hearing the variation in rappers’ sayings, be it accents or plays.

*To be expanded...*
