As we know, a semantic triple is made up of a _subject_, a _predicate_ and an _object_. From my language learning studies, I know that some grammars divide sentences into two: _subject_ and _predicate_. This is why I wanted to search for the division of the predicate into two: _relation_ (i.e. _predicate_) and _object_.

Firstly, it seems that the predicate and subject division occurred with the ancient philosophers, which doesn't mean it had not been thought of earlier. Since writing is a "recent" phenomenon, written history is too small. Back to philosophers, Aristotle thought that the division between _subject_ and _predicate_ is essential. As I understand, Plato articulated that the _relation_ (_predicate_) gives the _subject_ its **name**: <span style="font-family: georgia"> beauty â†’ beautiful </span> .

In an ontology, the _relation_ (_predicate_) needs to be separated from the _object_ for it to be generalizable. In linguistics, it's no worry to call the entire verbal phrase <span style="font-family: georgia"> "eat an apple" </span> a predicate; but, in an ontology, this wouldn't help us at all.

I learned, on the way, that the concept _Semantic triple_'s entry on Wikipedia [in French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_RDF) is a whole lot longer than the one [in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple). ðŸ˜® _:learning French on Duolingo:_
